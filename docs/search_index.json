In order to test the interest of this approach, we will try to produce multilingual dictionaries for the identification of five groups of entities : Europe and its subregions Africa and its subregions Asia and its subregions Mediterranea Middle East, Near East, Persian Gulf  The dictionary will be established in five languages of interest for the project IMAGEUN : english : applied to media of UK and Ireland french : applied to media of France and Tunisia german : applied to media of Germany turkish : applied to media of Turkey arabic : applied to media of Tunisia 4.2 Wikidata Wikidata defines itself as a free and open knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines. as central storage for the structured data of its Wikimedia sister projects including Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wiktionary, Wikisource, and others. a support to many other sites and services beyond just Wikimedia projects! The content of Wikidata is available under a free license, exported using standard formats, and can be interlinked to other open data sets on the linked data web. 4.2.1 Codification of entities The first interest of wikidata is to provide unique code of identifications of objects. For example a research about Africa will produce a list of different objects characterized by a unique code : knitr::include_graphics(&quot;pics/Wikidata001.png&quot;) 4.2.2 Informations on entities Once we have selected an entity (e.g. Q15) we obtain a new page with more detailed informations in english but also in all other languages available in Wikipedia. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;pics/Wikidata002.png&quot;) A lot of information are available concerning the entity but, at this stage, the most important ones for our research are : the translation in different languages the equivalent words or expression in different languages the definitions in different languages the ambiguity of the term in each language and the potential risks of confusion with other entities. Of course we should not take for granted the answers proposed by wikidata (as noticed by Georg, Wikipedia is a matter of research for IMAGEUN ) but without any doubt, it offers a very good opportunity to clarify our questions and help us to build tools for recognition of world regions and other geographical imaginations in a multilingual perspective. 4.2.3 Wikipedia entities as nodes of an ontolongy It appears crucial to introduce here a clear distinction between Wikipedia entities and textual units associated to the names and definiton of this units. A wikipedia entity like Q15 is an element of an ontology designed by its author for specific purposes. The specificity of the wikidata ontology is the fact that it is a multilinligual web where Q15 is a node of the web present in different linguistic layers. It means that we dont have a single name or a single definition of Q15, except if we adopt the neocolonial perspective to choose the english language as reference. Depending on the context (i.e. the language or sub-language), Q15 could be defined as : (fr) : A continent named Afrique\" (en) : A continent on the Earths northern and southern hemispheres named Africa or African continent (de) : A Kontinent auf der Nord- und Südhalbkugel der Erde named Afrika (tr) : A Dünyann kuzey ve güney yarkürelerindeki bir kta named Afrika or Afrika ktas (ar) : The \"               \" 1 named  or   In other words the existence of the same code of wikipedia entities does not offer any guarantee of concordance between the geographical objects found in news published in different languages or different countries. But - and it is the important point - it help us to point similarities and differences between set of geographical entities that are more or less comparable in each language. 4.2.4 A tool for cross-linguistical experiments Having in mind the limits of the equivalence of entities across languages, it can nevertheless be an interesting experience to select a set of wikipedia entities (Q15, Q258, Q4412 ) and to examine their relative frequency in our different media from different countries with different languages. A typical hypothesis could be something like : Is Q15 more mentionned than Q46 in Tunisian newspapers ? which is not equivalent to the question Is Africa more mentionned than Europe in Tunisian newspapers but rather equivalent to the two joint questions Is the textual unit Afrique more mentionned than the textual unit Europe in Tunisian newspapers published in french language. Is the textual unit  more mentionned than the textual unit  in Tunisian newspapers published in arabic language. 4.3 The package WikidataR The package WikidataR is an interface for the use of the Wikidata API in R language. Equivalent tools are available in Python and other languages for those non familiar with R. And it is of course possible to use directly the API. The first step is to install the most recent version of the R package WikidataR which install also related packages of interest. #install.packages(&quot;WikidataR&quot;) library(WikidataR) 4.3.1 Basic operations (based on Etienne Toureille previous experiments) 4.3.1.1 find_item This function help to find all wikipedia entities (=items) associated to a textual unit (word or group of word) in given language. Lets start with the research of entities associated to Afrique in french language : mytext &lt;- &quot;Afrique&quot; items &lt;- find_item(search_term = mytext, language = &quot;fr&quot;, limit=30) class(items) [1] &quot;find_item&quot; length(items) [1] 30 The resulting object is an object from type find_item which is in practice a list describing the entities that has been recognized associated to the textual unit that we have chosen. In the french cas, we have found 50 entities that match with our textual unit. Lets have a look at the first one : items[[1]] $id [1] &quot;Q15&quot; $title [1] &quot;Q15&quot; $pageid [1] 111 $repository [1] &quot;wikidata&quot; $url [1] &quot;//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15&quot; $concepturi [1] &quot;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15&quot; $label [1] &quot;Africa&quot; $description [1] &quot;continent on the Earth&#39;s northern and southern hemispheres&quot; $match $match$type [1] &quot;label&quot; $match$language [1] &quot;fr&quot; $match$text [1] &quot;Afrique&quot; $aliases $aliases[[1]] [1] &quot;Afrique&quot; As we can see we can easily identify the code the label and description in english but also the text responsible from the matching answer in french. We can therefore create a function item_info that extract all elements of interest and put them in a table in order to have a complete view. item_info &lt;- function(my_item){ item_id &lt;- my_item$id item_label &lt;- my_item$label item_desc &lt;- NA if (&quot;description&quot; %in% names(my_item)) {item_desc&lt;-my_item$description} item_lang &lt;- my_item$match$language item_text &lt;- my_item$match$text res&lt;-data.frame(item_id,item_label,item_desc,item_lang,item_text) return(res) } For example : item_info(items[[4]]) item_id item_label item_lang item_text 1 Q258 South Africa fr Afrique du Sud We build then a second function that extract all the wikipedia entities associated to a textual unit for a given language extract_entities &lt;- function(mytext= &quot;Afrique&quot;, mylang = &quot;fr&quot;, maxres = 20) { # Extract items items &lt;- find_item(search_term = mytext, language = mylang, limit = maxres) # Create empty dataset res&lt;-data.frame() res$item_id &lt;- as.character() res$item_label &lt;- as.character() res$item_desc &lt;- as.character() res$item_lang &lt;- as.character() res$item_text &lt;- as.character() # Fill dataset k&lt;-length(items) for (i in 1:k) { res &lt;- rbind(res,item_info(items[[i]])) } # Return dataset return(res) } For example : tab &lt;- extract_entities(&quot;Afrique&quot;,&quot;fr&quot;,100) kable(tab) item_id item_label item_desc item_lang item_text Q15 Africa continent on the Earths northern and southern hemispheres fr Afrique Q181238 Africa Roman province on the northern African coast covering parts of present-day

As we can see, many of the entities proposed in he list are not interesting and we will probably have to select one by one the entities of interest. But we have clearly to keep two different list of entities : the target entities : that we consider as potential world regions or candidate to te title of geographic imagination. the control entites : that we have to identify or eliminate if we want to identify correctly our target entities like the country of South Africa In the case of Africa, we could for example establish a more limited list target &lt;- c(&quot;Q15&quot;, &quot;Q4412&quot;,&quot;Q132959&quot;, &quot;Q27394&quot;,&quot;Q27407&quot;,&quot;Q27381&quot;,&quot;Q27433&quot;) control &lt;- c(&quot;Q258&quot;) tab&lt;-tab %&gt;% filter(item_id %in% c(target,control)) kable(tab) item_id item_label item_desc item_lang item_text Q15 Africa continent on the Earths northern and southern hemispheres fr Afrique Q258 South Africa sovereign state in Southern Africa fr Afrique du Sud Q4412 West Africa region of Africa fr Afrique de lOuest Q132959 Sub-Saharan Africa area of the continent of Africa that lies south of the Sahara Desert fr Afrique subsaharienne Q27394 Southern Africa southernmost region of the African continent fr Afrique australe Q27407 East Africa easterly region of the African continent fr Afrique de lEst Q27381 North Africa northernmost region of the African continent fr Afrique du Nord Q27433 Central Africa core region of the African continent fr Afrique centrale But this list which was based on the french textual units associated to Afrique should certainly be completed by equivalent list established for other languages with different seeds (Africa in english, Afrika in german, ) second largest continent in the world in terms of area and population, comes second only to Asia.
